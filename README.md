# Vision-Based Robot Collaboration App

This project is a vision-based application designed to help robots collaborate in real-world environments by moving objects. The robots do not have sensors, so all sensing is done through computer vision. The communication with the robots is over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Features

The Vision-Based Robot Collaboration App provides the following features:

- Object detection: The application can detect objects in the environment using computer vision techniques, such as image segmentation and object recognition.

- Object tracking: The application can track the movement of objects over time and predict their future positions, allowing the robots to plan their movements accordingly.

- Robot control: The application can send commands to the robots over BLE to move them to specific locations and collaborate with each other to move objects.

- User interface: The application has a graphical user interface that allows users to visualize the detected objects and the movements of the robots in real time.

## Technologies

The Vision-Based Robot Collaboration App was built using the following technologies:

- Python
- OpenCV
